Title:  Password Generator
Author: Jeet Ajmani, 2nd year UVic Music & Computer Science Student

This program was made for the June 20th, 2020 VikeHacks Hackathon.
The purpose of this Password Generator program is to generate a
strong password based on the user's limited specifications, such
as length, and the inclusion of certain characters in the
generated password.

When applying for scholarships or searching for learning tools,
I came across many organizations and websites which required
me to make an account to proceed. I made this Password Generator
with the intent that anyone who needs to randomly generate many
strong passwords can do so with ease, and with the option of
storing their passwords in a .txt file for later use.

The features of this program are:
    - a random password is generated through clicks on a GUI dialog
    - the length of the password is chosen on a slider
    - the user can check boxes to include uppercase letters, numbers,
      symbols, or special characters in their password, based on
      what they require
    - the user has the option of having the password written to a
      file in the current directory called passwordList.txt, which
      is automatically created
    - the password is copied to the clipboard for easy pasting

This program was written solely in Java (version 8).

The java source file is included, along with a jar file for easy
execution.
